                            <p>The four basic attributes in GURPS are Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX),
                                Intelligence (IQ), and Health (HT). Most skills are based either on IQ or
                                on DX, which is reflected in the fact that these attributes are worth 20
                                points per level. ST and HT are worth 10 points per level.
                                Note that this only starts counting when above 10. Any stats at 10 are just
                                0 cost. You gain back an equal number of points for each negative that you take.
                            </p>
                            <p>8 is the minimum you should go for a primary stat. 10 is considered average. 13 is
                                exceptional.
                                It is recommended that you spend at least half of your points in basic attributes.

                            <summary>About Strength</summary>
                            <p>Strength is very important because it equates to how much damage you can
                                take, represented as Hit Points (HP). HP can be adjusted with 2 points per
                                level, but you’ll rarely want to lower it. For any attack that uses the force of
                                your hand or arm, ST directly relates to the amount of damage that you can
                                inflict.</p>
                            <p>Encumbrance refers to how much weight you are carrying. The greater your
                                Encumbrance, the slower you move. Most characters function at Light
                                Encumbrance, which is twice your Basic Lift. Basic Lift equals the square
                                of your ST divided by 5 (ST × ST ÷ 5).</p>

                            <p>Your Basic Speed is a calculated value that is used to determine how quickly
                                you react to a situation, your Basic Move, and your Dodge. Basic Speed is
                                calculated by adding Dexterity and Health and dividing by 4.

                                Your Dodge defense equals Basic Speed +
                                3, dropping all fractions. For instance,
                                if your Basic Speed is 5.25, your Dodge
                                is 8.

                                Basic Move starts out equal to
                                Basic Speed, less any fractions; e.g.,
                                Basic Speed 5.75 gives Basic Move 5.

                                Basic lift is how much weight you can put over your head in 1 sec with one arm.

                                    Behavior, this is not a daily
                                    habit, but an overpowering fixation
                                    that motivates all of your actions. And
                                    unlike Fanaticism, this does
                                    not necessarily imply a set of philosophical
                                    beliefs.
                                    You must rationalize all of your
                                    actions as an attempt to reach your
                                    goal. Make a self-control roll whenever
                                    it would be wise to deviate from
                                    your goal. If you fail, you continue to
                                    pursue your Obsession, regardless of
                                    the consequences.
                                    Point cost depends on the time

                                    goal (e.g., assassinating someone)
                                    is worth -5 points, while a longterm
                                    goal (e.g., becoming President) is
                                    worth -10 points. In both cases, modify
                                    the base cost to reflect your self control
                                    number.

                                    Your points are a combination of two things.  Your base attribute plus/minus the
                                    modifier.  I.e. if you use acrobatics as an example, it uses Dexterity with a -6 for the untrained.
                                    So if you have a Dexterity of ten and attempt an acrobatics feat, you have a
                                    10 for Dexterity, -6 for untrained, so a 4.  Or a 1d-2 roll.  Or a 1.9% odds of success.
