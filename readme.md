# The Feedback Loop

This is a modified version of GURPS rules using Harmon Cooper's *The Feedback Loop* as the inspiration.  This means no permadeaths, resets back to the beginning of the day, etc.

The live version is currently at [github.io](https://noman2000.github.io/feedbackloop-charactersheet/)
