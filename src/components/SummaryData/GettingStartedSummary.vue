    <p>
      This page is designed to help you get up and running quickly with a new character build.
      All of the points and deductions are calculated <i>automatically</i>. You can hover over
      the question marks or expand the details sections by clicking on the arrow to get more
      information, but you never
      need to worry about how to calculate statistics, how many points you have left, etc. All of this
      will
      be handled automatically and reactively. As you change something, everything will update
      accordingly.
      Anything hidden in a details section will automatically be updated when you change the
      appropriate stats.
      If you can't see it, you don't need to worry about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some attributes have a <span class="text-muted">Greyish text like this</span> on them.
      This means that you either lack a <b>prerequisite</b> or have an <b>incompatible</b> talent.
      There will be a question mark symbol that will explain what the prerequisite or incompatible
      talent is.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a case of the former, you cannot be an expert in parrying in unarmed combat if you do not
      have an expert level in melee combat. In the case of the latter, you cannot be bloodthirsty and
      also be a pacifist.
      You also cannot <i>stack</i> the same types of advantages or disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some differences in this ruleset. I.e. <i>The Feedback Loop</i> doesn't have any
      requirements for
      backpacks, and there's no indication of encumbrance statistics. Hence, we will not use them in
      our game, but
      they will still be included as reference material.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this campaign, the player points will start at 100. Points and money will be
      awarded based on play.
    </p>
    <p>When you are done with the character creation, print it out and send it to me. I will then input
      the
      scores into roll20 so that any rolls are done automatically.</p>
    <h5>If you find Bugs</h5>
    <p>Please report all bugs to <a href="https://github.com/NoMan2000/feedbackloop-charactersheet/issues">The
      Github Issue Tracker</a>.
      This will help me make improvements to this. Use Chrome, as I haven't tested this out very thoroughly in
      other browsers.
