    <p>Skills are rated in terms of difficulty to learn, from Easy through Average to
      Hard. Buying certain levels of a skill is dependant on the difficulty. Like most things,
      starting off skills are generally pretty easy to get, but mastery is exceptionally
      difficult.

    <dl>
      <dt>Advantage:</dt>
      <dd>A useful trait that gives you an “edge” over another person
        with comparable attributes and skills.
      </dd>
      <dt>Attributes:</dt>
      <dd>Four numbers – Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Health
        – that rate a character’s most basic abilities. Higher is always better!
      </dd>
      <dt>Cinematic:</dt>
      <dd>A style of play where the needs of the story outweigh those
        of realism, even when that would produce improbable results.
      </dd>
      <dt>D:</dt>
      <dd>Short for “dice.” “<i>Roll 3d6</i>” means “roll three ordinary six-sided dice
        and add them up.” Roll 4d20 means roll 4d20 dice. The GURPS system only uses d6
        dice.
      </dd>
      <dt>Dexterity (DX):</dt>
      <dd>An attribute that measures agility and coordination.</dd>
      <dt>Disadvantage:</dt>
      <dd>A problem that renders you less capable than your other
        traits would indicate.
      </dd>
      <dt>Enhancement:</dt>
      <dd>An extra capability added to a trait. This increases the
        point cost of the trait by a percentage.
      </dd>
      <dt>Fatigue Points (FP):</dt>
      <dd>A measure of resistance to exhaustion.</dd>

      <dd>An attribute that measures physical grit and vitality.</dd>
      <dt>Hit Points (HP):</dt>
      <dd>A measure of ability to absorb punishment.</dd>
      <dt>Intelligence (IQ):</dt>
      <dd>An attribute that measures brainpower.</dd>
      <dt>Limitation:</dt>
      <dd>A restriction on the use of a trait. This reduces the point cost
        of the trait by a percentage.
      </dd>
      <dt>Point:</dt>
      <dd>The unit of “currency” spent to buy traits for a character. The
        more points you have, the more capable you are.
      </dd>
      <dt>Prerequisite:</dt>
      <dd>A trait you must have to qualify for another trait. If the
        prerequisite is a skill, you must have at least one point in it.
      </dd>
      <dt>Skill:</dt>
      <dd>A number defining your trained ability in an area of knowledge
        or broad class of tasks.
      </dd>

      <dt>Trait:</dt>

        “building block” that affects game play and costs points to add,
        modify, or remove.
