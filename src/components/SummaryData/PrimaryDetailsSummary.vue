        <dd>It can be important to know what you do for a living when
          you’re not adventuring (unless adventuring is your job – lucky you!) and
          how long you spend doing it. This determines your income and on-the-job
          training opportunities. Military characters should keep a service record.

        <dt>Life History.</dt>
        <dd>If you write down your character story, keep it in a separate
          file so you can easily expand it as your adventures unfold.
        </dd>
        <dt>Vital Statistics.</dt>
        <dd>If you think your parents’ names, your place and date
          of birth (or zodiacal birth sign), your bloodline (or race – in some settings,
          you might need to specify that you are an ordinary human!), and similar
          traits are likely to matter, keep a separate “personnel file” on yourself that
          contains such details.
