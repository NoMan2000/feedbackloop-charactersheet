    <ul>
      <li><b>6 or less:</b> Crippling. An attribute this bad severely constrains your
        lifestyle.
      </li>
      <li><b>7: Poor.</b> Your limitations are immediately obvious to anyone who
        meets you. This is the lowest score you can have and still pass for “ablebodied.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>8 or 9:</b> Below average. Such scores are limiting, but within the human
        norm. The GM may forbid attributes below 8 to active adventurers.
      </li>
      <li><b>10: Average.</b> Most humans get by just fine with a score of 10!</li>
      <li><b>11 or 12:</b> Above average. These scores are superior, but within the
        human norm.
      </li>
      <li><b>13 or 14:</b> Exceptional. Such an attribute is immediately apparent – as
        bulging muscles, feline grace, witty dialog, or glowing health – to those
        who meet you.
      </li>
      <li><b>15 or more:</b> Amazing. An attribute this high draws constant comment
        and probably guides your career choices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The four basic attributes in GURPS are Strength (ST), Dexterity (DX),
      Intelligence (IQ), and Health (HT). Most skills are based either on IQ or
      on DX, which is reflected in the fact that these attributes are worth 20
      points per level. ST and HT are worth 10 points per level.
      Note that this only starts counting when above 10. Any stats at 10 are just
      0 cost. You gain back an equal number of points for each negative that you take.
    </p>
    <p>8 is the minimum you should go for a primary stat. 10 is considered average. 13 is
      exceptional.
      It is recommended that you spend at least half of your points in basic attributes.

    <summary>About Strength</summary>
    <p>Strength is very important because it equates to how much damage you can
      take, represented as Hit Points (HP). HP can be adjusted with 2 points per
      level, but you’ll rarely want to lower it. For any attack that uses the force of
      your hand or arm, ST directly relates to the amount of damage that you can
      inflict.</p>
    <p>Encumbrance refers to how much weight you are carrying. The greater your
      Encumbrance, the slower you move. Most characters function at Light
      Encumbrance, which is twice your Basic Lift. Basic Lift equals the square
      of your ST divided by 5 (ST × ST ÷ 5).</p>
