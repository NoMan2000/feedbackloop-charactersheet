                    <h4 class="card-title">How this page works</h4>
                    <p>
                        This page is designed to help you get up and running quickly with a new character build.
                        All of the points and deductions are calculated <i>automatically</i>. You can hover over
                        the question marks or expand the details sections by clicking on the arrow to get more
                        information, but you never
                        need to worry about how to calculate statistics, how many points you have left, etc. All of this
                        will
                        be handled automatically and reactively. As you change something, everything will update
                        accordingly.
                        Anything hidden in a details section will automatically be updated when you change the
                        appropriate stats.
                        If you can't see it, you don't need to worry about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some attributes have a <span class="text-muted">Greyish text like this</span> on them.
                        This means that you either lack a <b>prerequisite</b> or have an <b>incompatible</b> talent.
                        There will be a question mark symbol that will explain what the prerequisite or incompatible
                        talent is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a case of the former, you cannot be an expert in parrying in unarmed combat if you do not
                        have an expert level in melee combat. In the case of the latter, you cannot be bloodthirsty and
                        also be a pacifist.
                        You also cannot <i>stack</i> the same types of advantages or disadvantages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are some differences in this ruleset. I.e. <i>The Feedback Loop</i> doesn't have any
                        requirements for
                        backpacks, and there's no indication of encumbrance statistics. Hence, we will not use them in
                        our game, but
                        they will still be included as reference material.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this campaign, the player points will start at 100. Points and money will be
                        awarded based on play.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you are done with the character creation, print it out and send it to me. I will then input
                        the
                        scores into roll20 so that any rolls are done automatically.</p>

                                Intelligence (IQ), and Health (HT). Most skills are based either on IQ or
                                on DX, which is reflected in the fact that these attributes are worth 20
                                points per level. ST and HT are worth 10 points per level.
                                Note that this only starts counting when above 10. Any stats at 10 are just
                                0 cost. You gain back an equal number of points for each negative that you take.

                            <p>8 is the minimum you should go for a primary stat. 10 is considered average. 13 is
                                exceptional.
                                It is recommended that you spend at least half of your points in basic attributes.

                            <p>Strength is very important because it equates to how much damage you can
                                take, represented as Hit Points (HP). HP can be adjusted with 2 points per
                                level, but you’ll rarely want to lower it. For any attack that uses the force of
                                your hand or arm, ST directly relates to the amount of damage that you can
                                inflict.</p>
                            <p>Encumbrance refers to how much weight you are carrying. The greater your
                                Encumbrance, the slower you move. Most characters function at Light
                                Encumbrance, which is twice your Basic Lift. Basic Lift equals the square
                                of your ST divided by 5 (ST × ST ÷ 5).</p>

                            <p>Your Basic Speed is a calculated value that is used to determine how quickly
                                you react to a situation, your Basic Move, and your Dodge. Basic Speed is
                                calculated by adding Dexterity and Health and dividing by 4.

                                Your Dodge defense equals Basic Speed +
                                3, dropping all fractions. For instance,
                                if your Basic Speed is 5.25, your Dodge
                                is 8.

                                Basic Move starts out equal to
                                Basic Speed, less any fractions; e.g.,
                                Basic Speed 5.75 gives Basic Move 5.

                                Basic lift is how much weight you can put over your head in 1 sec with one arm.

                                <p>Damage is divided into three types: Thrust, Swing, and Thrown. This will just show

                                    ratio between strength and thrust/swing. A thrust attack is a basic attack like
                                    a punch, kick, or bite, or an
                                    attack with a thrusting weapon such
                                    as a spear or a rapier.</p>

                                    baseball bat, hammer, sword, etc.

                                    modifier. I.e. if you use acrobatics as an example, it uses Dexterity with a -6 for
                                    the untrained.
                                    So if you have a Dexterity of ten and attempt an acrobatics feat, you have a
                                    10 for Dexterity, -6 for untrained, so a 4. Or a 1d-2 roll. Or a 1.9% odds of
                                    success.
